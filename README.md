# Lilly Estética: Offline Conversion

This is a simple project to register offline conversions.

A conversion happens from a lead that was generated by a Facebook or Google Ad, and then the lead is converted into a customer. This project is a simple way to register this conversion.

Everytime a lead is generated, it is registered in the Database using this project. The lead is registered with the following information:

1. uniqueId (generated by the Lilly Estética's website)
2. search (parameter used to find the lead)
3. baseUrl (the website's url)
4. referrer (the website's referrer)
5. createdAt (the date and time the lead was generated)

When the lead is converted into a customer, the uniqueId is used to find the lead in the Database.
